Full Intro:

This program is intended to show the user the basics of making variables, while giving a kind introduction to conditional statements.

The goal is to start off by making a variable for your name. The syntax for this variable is important. Running the program after making this single name will provide no output, as intended. Note that when we make a variable, that does not necessarily display it for the user, it just stores data in the background.

We can make another variable for our age. This variable is going to look different than our name, because it's holding a number instead of a word.

Below those two lines, we print "<name> is <age> years old!" in order to finally display the values we have given our variables.

Then we can continue making more variables for another person, perhaps a superhero or someone you know. Another variable for their name, their age, and printing that information out.

Now our goal is to compare ourselves against that user; check to see if you're older, younger, or the same age as this person using some if statements.

But when we make a program, we can easily assume anyone else using the program is not going to have your exact name and age. So we can use inputs to allow the user to type in their own name and age. We replace the values we initially gave our first two variables with inputs. Note: age is a number, so it must be converted using int() to become an integer.
