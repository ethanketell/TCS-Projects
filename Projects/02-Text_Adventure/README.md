Purpose: The text adventure game is a fun, basic conditional system. The purpose of a story like this is not to be a good storyteller, so don't worry if your story is not very interesting. You can also feel free to use mine. The purpose of this program is to show that conditional statements can work inside of one another, and variables can be repurposed for other means later on. We need an introduction (e.g, "You wake up ina  forest, with no other signs of human life in sight."), a series of main options, (e.g, "You must choose from: 1. Enter the nearby cave, 2. Follow the dirt trail over a hill, 3. Walk deeper into the forest"), and some options for each of those choices that have a very final outcome. 

Learned: More on conditionals and formatting in various languages.

Example output:

Welcome to my text adventure game
You wake up in a forest, with no other signs of human life in sight. You don't remember arriving here, and do not recognize where you are.
You're right on top of a trail, which leads three different ways that you must choose from:
1. Enter the nearby cave
2. Follow the dirt trail over a hill
3. Walk deeper into the forest.
Please type the number for your choice: >>>1
You enter the cave, to find a bear is comfortably laying down, its head on its hands.
Instinctually, you choose to:
1. Attack the bear
2. Sneak past the bear
3. Try to befriend the bear
Please type the number for your choice: >>>1
What were you thinking? You can't fight a bear! You were eaten!
