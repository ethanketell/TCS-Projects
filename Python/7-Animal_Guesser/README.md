Purpose: The purpose of this project is to allow the programmer to make a subject-based guessing program. You do not need to write about animals! Write about something you're interested in! This one was just written about animals because that was the topic my student was most compelled to write about.

Learned: The basics of opening and reading from files, using arrays, and using libraries to solve basic problems like finding a file. 

Example output:

Welcome to my Animal Guessing Game
This animal sometimes lives in houses

Enter guess here: >>>dog
This animal is sometimes gray

Enter guess here: >>>rat
You win!
