Description: This program is a basic calculator. Nothing more, nothing less. It will take in the three important parts of doing a very short math problem: a number, an operator, and another number.

Learned: This is more practice with making variables, conditions, and printing information like our name-age program. However, this is a kind introduction to the world of "using programming to do mathematical problems for us". They, of course, get much more difficult as the list goes on.

Example output: 

Welcome to my basic, two number calculator.
Please enter your first number >>>8
Please type your operator (+,-,*,/) >>>*
Please enter your second number >>>7
