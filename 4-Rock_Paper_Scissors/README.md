Purpose: This program is made to get some practice using random numbers. We want to be able to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with our computer, so how will it choose a choice? We don't have the time or the expertise to write out an intelligent "Rock Paper Scissors" player, so we will have to make it choose a random option!

Learned: Random number generation, practice with formatting and basic replayability.

Example output: 

Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors! Your opponent is the computer!
Choose 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors': >>>rock
You lost, CPU chose paper!
