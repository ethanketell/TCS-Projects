Purpose: The purpose of this project is to be able to have a specific number of guesses before we start the game, and to be able to successfully guess a randomly generated number in that number of guesses. 

Learned: This is the first project to provide a use for loops other than for restarting a game (Text-Adventure did that). This project is nothing necessarily new otherwise, however it reinforces the random number generation practice and maintaining variable values. 

Example output:
